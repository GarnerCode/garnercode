        "Beginning in 2018, one year after I graduated high school, I started my journey to becoming a professional web developer by teaching myself HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I then furthered my skillset by attending Glendale Community College and earning a Certificate in Web Development in 2020.",
        "I then progressed my web development skills by learning React, but was granted the opportunity to quickly adapt to Vue and Angular in a professional environment, and as such, my skills in the latter two frameworks increased exponentially.",
        "Currently, my focus is in Vue and Nuxt to build complex web applications and generate high-speed static websites. As I am front-end focused, I utilize Firebase when backend structure is necessary in order to build secure full-stack websites and applications.",
        "When I'm not coding, you can find me staying active with paintball, or writing campaigns for Dungeons & Dragons!",
        "If you have any questions, or are interested in working with me, contact me today!"
